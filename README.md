# a4940_smt_motor_controller


Hbridge PCB made in Kicad. 

Uses the Allegro A4940 controller chip and 4 N channel mosfets. 

I used the LR7833, but many others would probably work if the pins match.

Powered with 2X LM317's from the same power as the motor. 

Features an extra power bus so you can configure it to power other things at different voltages. 

Tested and seems to work really well.
